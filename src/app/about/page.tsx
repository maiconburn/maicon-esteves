            I am a <strong>Senior Growth Developer</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> with a strong focus on creating
            scalable and innovative solutions. My journey in software
            engineering has been enriched by a unique blend of technical
            expertise, entrepreneurship, and leadership. I hold a{" "}
            <strong>Master&apos;s degree in Entrepreneurship</strong> from
            Falmouth University and a{" "}
            <strong>Bachelor&apos;s degree in Marketing</strong> from UNOPAR -
            University of Northern Paran√°.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my current role as a <strong>Software Developer</strong> at
            <strong> Remotasks</strong>, I excel in developing high-quality
            AI-driven solutions with a performance rate of 94.44%. Prior to
            this, I led significant projects at <strong>MADE BY ON</strong>,
            working with renowned clients like Ernst & Young and Exclaimer,
            where I saved two months of development time through innovative
            integrations.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an entrepreneur, I co-founded two companies:{" "}
            <strong>Invalley Innovation and Design</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Adeus Rotina</strong>. At Invalley, we focus on innovation
            through the design and development of products, services, and
            strategies aimed at improving lives. Adeus Rotina offered a unique
            subscription service delivering romantic experiences for couples. In
            both ventures, I oversaw marketing and technology, driving growth
            and operational efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            My background is complemented by my technical skills in frontend and
            backend development, including proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            React, Next.js, and various other modern technologies. Additionally,
            I have experience with DevOps tools like Docker, AWS, and Vercel,
            ensuring robust and scalable deployments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond my professional pursuits, I am passionate about contributing
            to society. I have volunteered with organizations like{" "}
            <strong>Sonhar Acordado</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Junior Achievement</strong>, where I mentored youth and
            guided startups on business models as part of{" "}
            <strong>Techstars Startup Weekend</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that serving humanity is one of the most fulfilling
            endeavors, and I strive to make a positive impact through my work,
            both in technology and in my community involvement.
